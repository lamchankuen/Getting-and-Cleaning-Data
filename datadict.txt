Data Set Information:

This dataset is a summary of an expriment on human activity recognition using 
smartphones. The summary includes mean and standard deviation of by the studied 
subject and activity. 

The original data set: 

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an 
age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, 
WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a 
smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer 
and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular 
velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded 
to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned 
into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the 
training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying 
noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 
50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has 
gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth 
low-pass filter into body 5/10/2014 UCI Machine Learning Repository: Human

2/2 acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only 
low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. 
From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables 
from the time and frequency domain.

Attribute Information:

For each record in the dataset it is provided:
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
- Its activity identification and activity name.
- A 67-feature vector with means and standard deviations of with time and frequency domain variables. 

Feature Selection 
=================
The features selected for this database come from the SUMMARIZED accelerometer 
and gyroscope 3-axial signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals 
(prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they 
were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter 
with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal 
was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and 
tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency 
of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time 
to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude 
of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm 
(tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals 
producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, 
fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
